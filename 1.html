                    bookkeeping.</p>
                <p>Doctor: -So you supervise the jobs or the people-?</p>
                <p>Patient: -No ma’am, I don’t I supervise but I, I’m in the office-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -You’re in office.</p>
                <p>Patient: Mm-hmm. Work with billing and whatnot.</p>
                <p>Doctor: You’ve always done that type of work?</p>
                <p>Patient: Yeah, when I was working with US Steel up in Pittsburgh, I was uh, working in the office.
                </p>
                <p>Doctor: Mm-hmm. How’d you choose this area?</p>
                <p>Patient: Well umm, US Steel was getting ready for another round of layoff’s and so I was looking for
                    something with somewhat similar office needs… I found this one on the internet and it just looked
                    like a really good opportunity for a fresh start.</p>
                <p>Doctor: But you don’t have family here?</p>
                <p>Patient: No. It’s just me. My son might be joining me umm, in probably six months to a year-, it
                    depends on how his job goes.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Okay. Well it’s a pretty nice place to live.</p>
                <p>Patient: It’s beautiful.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Uh, and the people are in general, good people. They really are.</p>
                <p>Patient: I really like it. It, it’s umm, I mean you got all the conveniences of-, you know, it’s a
                    short distance to get to what you need but at the same time, it’s not so busy and so over-packed
                    like Pittsburgh is.</p>
                <p>Doctor: There’s a lot to offer in the way of education and arts, science, you name it.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Umm, the hemorrhoids that you’ve had, were they related to <span
                        class="med-history">pregnancy</span> or?</p>
                <p>Patient: Umm-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -Something-</p>
                <p>Patient: -I didn’t notice any problems with them until umm, I <span class="symptoms">started having
                        more issues with constipation</span>-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -Mm-hmm.</p>
                <p>Patient: Just the straining. So every once in a while they’ll just be a tiny bit of blood on the
                    tissue but that’s it.</p>
                <p>Doctor: When was the last complete physical you had?</p>
                <p>Patient: A year.</p>
                <p>Doctor: <span class="med-history">pap smear</span>, breast exam-</p>
                <p>Patient: Mm-hmm, it’s been a year.</p>
                <p>Doctor: -And all that stuff. Okay. Now lets get into your bowel issue a little bit here and then
                    schedule a complete physical-</p>
                <p>Patient: -Okay-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -Like to go over you from top to bottom.</p>
                <p>Patient: Sure.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Any <span class="symptoms">chest pain</span> of any kind?</p>
                <p>Patient: Mm-mm (no).</p>
                <p>Doctor: So going back to your tummy. Did umm, have you ever had an ulcer? A documented ulcer from
                    worry or stress or anything?</p>
                <p>Patient: No.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Okay. How old were you when you started getting variations of <span
                        class="symptoms">diarrhea?</span> </p>
                <p>Patient: Umm, it kind of came and went for a bit umm, for about I guess probably good close to five
                    years before umm, we did the <span class="med-history">colonoscopy</span> and he diagnosed me.</p>
                <p>Doctor: So if you get a flare up now, do you have any medicine to take to quiet it down?</p>
                <p>Patient: Umm, if I’m constipated I do the Ex-Lax and umm, if I have diarrhea, usually it’s just like
                    one or two little bouts and then you know, flip over into constipation and so I don’t usually have
                    to do anything for diarrhea.</p>
                <p>Doctor: But you’re not taking a lot of over the counter Imodium or-</p>
                <p>Patient: -No, umm, I try to stay on top of it <span class="medication">taking plenty of the
                        Metamucil</span> just to keep the fiber going.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Yeah. Well that sounds good. umm-</p>
                <p>Patient: -And I’ve had the diarrhea and constipation-, I’ve been dealing with that for years. Umm,
                    but this changed. This is-, this is different so it’s just got me concerned-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -But-, what we do-, we have another change in bowel habits-</p>
                <p>Patient: -Mm-hmm-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -And you have some <span class="symptoms">abdomen pain.</span> </p>
                <p>Patient: Mm-hmm.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Okay. I think we need to work the GI tract and possibly get another <span
                        class="med-history">colonoscopy.</span> If you’re up to it.</p>
                <p>Patient: Well not today but-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -No-, -Not.</p>
                <p>Patient: Okay-</p>
                <p>Doctor: You’ve had a lot going on so this can just be situational-</p>
                <p>Patient: -Yeah-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -But I think that umm-, anybody in your family have colon cancer?</p>
                <p>Patient: No. No, uh-, my umm, my mom’s mom, <span class="med-history">had cancer</span> umm, but she
                    was in her nineties and we-</p>
                <p>Doctor: -Oh-</p>
                <p>Patient: I mean I’ve </span class="symptoms">had the constipation</span>, I’ve <span
                        class="symptoms">had the diarrhea</span>-, but it-.</p>
                <p>Doctor: -It’s never been like this-</p>
                <p>Patient: -It’s been happening before. I’ve just never had it happen in the same bowel movement.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Oh really-</p>
                <p>Patient: -I mean this is-, it’s just different. This is different-, I will strain and push and just
                    liquid will come out and then all of a sudden it will just be a solid piece of stool. And then
                    liquid. And it’s-, I, I’ve never had that happen.</p>
                <p>Doctor: So, but I still feel like you need, you know, somebody to look at your bowel.</p>
                <p>Patient: Okay.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Okay. So we’ll go ahead-, are you <span class="symptoms">having pain in your stomach</span>
                    now?</p>
                <p>Patient: It’s tender.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Mm-hmm. Does it wake you up at night when you go to bed?</p>
                <p>Patient: Mm-mm (no).</p>
                <p>Doctor: Let me get that young lady in here, give me just a second. Uh, Natalie? You can button up.
                    Okay I’m going to get her ready for a general physical and I’ll need all my usual CBC and do,
                    (inaudible 59:43.9). How we prove liver functions.</p>
                <p>Nurse: Alright.</p>
                <p>Doctor: Okay. And uh, get me a c-peptide on her. So, it’ll be a B, 70.0.</p>
                <p>Nurse: Okay.</p>
                <p>Doctor: With her physical. And if you could just write the instructions on the top.</p>
                <p>Nurse: Alright, I’ll be back.</p>
                <p>Patient: Is that for me?</p>
                <p>Doctor: This is Natalie-</p>
                <p>Patient: <span class="intro">Hi Natalie</span>.</p>

                <p>Patient: Not yet.</p>
                <p>Doctor: -Here’s for you to give to the lab. But call ahead of time and see how things are running.
