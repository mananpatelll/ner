                <p>Doctor: Have you taken prescription medicines for your <span class="med-histroy">IBS</span> before?

                <p>Patient: Mm mm. It’s just it’s tender there and that’s more tender.</p>

                <p>Doctor: It’s pretty tender. And right here okay?</p>

                <p>Patient: Yes. I mean <span class="Physical-exam">it’s uncomfortable over there </span>.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Do you feel bloated?</p>

                <p>Patient: A little bit.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Have you <span class="med-history">had a colonoscopy before?</span></p>

                <p>Patient: It’s just kind of in general uncomfortable</p>

                <p>Doctor: Okay. Not particularly in one space.</p>

                <p>Patient: Um over here was more</p>

                <p>Doctor: When I examined it it was more</p>

                <p>Patient: Yeah.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Over there over on the left.</p>

                <p>Patient: Yeah</p>

                <p>Doctor: Mhm yeah. That’s how it happens. I mean if you had a, if you had to say what was different
                    about your usual IBS pain and this? Just that it’s more constant or more severe or more..?</p>

                <p>Patient: Well it’s. I didn’t <span class="symptoms">have constant pain</span> before and then um
                    every once in a while I’ll have an episode where it flares up even more, more so.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Mhm.</p>

                <p>Patient: And that’s relatively new. Um I mean before it was just it was uncomfortable and I was
                    constipated and <span class="symptoms">I had diarrhea and it was more of a nuisance.</span></p>

                <p>Doctor: Okay</p>

                <p>Patient: And now it’s there’s pain involved. And it’s um, I’m getting more concerned</p>

                <p>Doctor: Mhm</p>

                <p>Patient: Um because of the change</p>

                <p>Doctor: Mhm</p>

                <p>Patient: I’ve never had this before</p>

                <p>Doctor: Okay. And so the pain the the so the pain was never a big component.</p>

                <p>Patient: And being tired all the time too</p>

                <p>Doctor: Uh huh</p>

                <p>Patient: And that’s got me worried so</p>

                <p>Doctor: Sure</p>

                <p>Patient: The first time the pain was during my son’s birthday six months ago and then its off and on.
                </p>

                <p>Doctor: And that was pain.</p>

                <p>Patient: Now all of a sudden it’s a constant pain.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Okay. But you <span class="emotions">feel like </span>it’s been kinda off and on for six
                    months?</p>

                <p>Patient: It was off and on at first.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Yeah.</p>

                <p>Patient: In the last two three weeks it’s been constant.</p>

                <p>Doctor: It’s been constant.</p>

                <p>Patient: Yeah.</p>

                <p>Doctor: You haven’t had any <span class="symptoms">fever</span>?</p>

                <p>Patient: No.</p>

                <p>Doctor: I mean that’s my you know. I don’t wanna have to put you through a whole whole bunch of tests
                </p>

                <p>Patient: Right</p>

                <p>Doctor: You know? On the other hand I I don’t wanna just be like oh it’s your IBS you know what I
                    mean?</p>

                <p>Patient: Mhm</p>

                <p>Doctor: So it it’s kind of a tough call. So I keep asking you like the same questions fifty different
                    ways just to kind of make sure I completely understand what’s going on.</p>

                <p>Patient: It’s fine</p>

                <p>Doctor: Um you know with it, what you’re saying and really it’s been present just intermittent for
                    six months and in the last few weeks it’s been more constant.</p>

                <p>Patient: Mhm</p>

                <p>Doctor: Um you know that certainly could be your IBS I mean if you having any you know fevers and
                    vomiting and stuff like that…</p>

                <p>Patient: Right.</p>

                <p>Doctor: I would think you were sick which y- you know I think what you worry about when you’re tender
                    particularly on the left is something called Diverticulitis</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay</p>

                <p>Doctor: But that usually makes you pretty un- pretty unwell</p>

                <p>Patient: Mhm.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Usually with Diverticulitis you’re you have a significant you know you’re really, really
                    uncomfortable and there’s a dramatic change.</p>

                <p>Patient: Right</p>

                <p>Doctor: But all of a sudden this has started. It wouldn’t be sort of smoldering off and on for a long
                    time</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay</p>

                <p>Doctor: So I think that’s not likely.</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay.</p>

                <p>Doctor: You know I think what that is, is your <span class="med-history">IBS</span>. I think what I’d
                    like to do is give you some a prescription for some medicine that just stops the cramping</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay</p>

                <p>Doctor: To see if that will help</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay</p>

                <p>Doctor: And then um also I’d like to <span class="tests-offered">some blood work</span> especially
                    cuz of the tiredness because you don’t feel well. I want to make sure that you haven’t gotten anemic
                    or that you know liver, kidney all that is doing well. If that’s okay with you.</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay.</p>

                <p>Doctor: So let’s let’s plan on that. Okay?</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Um why don’t you get dressed and I’ll be right back. Okay?</p>

                <p>Patient: Thank you.</p>

                <p>Doctor: Sure. (leaves room 1:01:59-1:06:22) Alright so I would like for you to try something called
                    Hyoscyamine. It is been around forever. Anti-cramping kind of thing</p>

                <p>Patient: Okay</p>

                <p>Doctor: <span class="medication">I would keep up with your Metamucil </span></p>

                <p>Patient: Alright.</p>

                <p>Doctor: As you know the Irritable Bowel part of the issue is you got you got that tightness because
                    it’s trying to push everything out. It hurts</p>

                <p>Patient: Yeah</p>

                <p>Doctor: Let’s do that twice a day. I need to know if you get a fever. I need to know if you get
                    worse. If you’re not able to eat. I need to know you’re vomiting anything like that changes. Okay?
                </p>

                <p>Patient: Okay</p>

                <p>Doctor: <span class="tests offered"> i need your blood work today for the blood count.</span></p>
